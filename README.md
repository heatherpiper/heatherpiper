## Welcome üëã

My name is Heather Piper, and I am full stack developer in Columbus, Ohio. Prior to being a developer, I worked as a court reporter and ran a successful 3D printing business that fulfilled nearly 1,000 online orders over three years. I graduated from Tech Elevator's Java bootcamp in September 2023.

### Recent Projects

- üö≤[amsTOURdam](https://github.com/heatherpiper/amsTOURdam-final_capstone) - Web app that allows users to create custom itineraries from a curated list of experiences and activities within the city of Amsterdam. Users can search and browse a database of landmarks, drag landmark cards into and out of itineraries for easy editing, build custom color-coded routes, and upload photos of their travels. This was my final capstone project for Tech Elevator's Java bootcamp. **Tools used**: Java, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, Vue.js, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, GitLab, Google Maps API, Cloudinary API

- üìñ Online Java Knowledge Base (Private) - Centralized repository for fellow Tech Elevator graduates that organizes and catalogues the Java curriculum, quizzes, videos, and other online resources that served as part of the instruction during Tech Elevator's Java bootcamp for Cohort 20.

### Current Projects

- üèâ [My AFL Ladder](https://github.com/heatherpiper/my-AFL-ladder) - As an American fan of Australian Rules Football and the AFL, it can be difficult to monitor team rankings without being spoiled for games that happen overnight. This app takes the concept of a live ladder and adds the functionality for a user to check off only the games they have watched. The ladder will be updated only once instructed by the user, allowing them to view a ladder that is "live" according to the games watched by the user. **Tools used**:

### Future Projects

- üé® Custom color themes for IntelliJ IDEA and VS Code
- ü§î Trivia Trainer - a quiz app focused on training the user to retain information an improve performance for in-person trivia nights. Questions will be categorized in a database to allow for filtering based on the user's chosen criteria to allow for the focus to be on domains in need of improvement.

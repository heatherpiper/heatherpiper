## Welcome üëã

My name is Heather Piper, and I am full stack developer in Columbus, Ohio. Prior to being a developer, I worked as a court reporter and ran a successful 3D printing business that fulfilled nearly 1,000 online orders over three years. I graduated from Tech Elevator's Java bootcamp in September 2023.

### Current Projects

- üèâ **[Later Ladder](https://github.com/heatherpiper/Later-Ladder)** - **You can now view Later Ladder live at [LaterLadder.com](https://www.laterladder.com)**. As an American fan of Aussie rules football and the Australian Football League (AFL), one of the challenges I've faced is the inconvenience of checking current team standings without inadvertently spoiling match results that occurred overnight. Later Ladder offers a solution: it displays an updated team ladder that only refreshes as the user personally marks off the games they've watched. This unique feature ensures that you can stay informed about the current AFL standings while preserving the excitement of each match. **Tools used**: Java, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, Vue.js, HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

- üñåÔ∏è **[Color Highlighter](https://www.github.com/heatherpiper/color-highlighter)** - Plugin for Obsidian.md that automatically detects and highlights color codes in your notes. Customizeable settings allow you to choose where highlights happen and how they appear. Detects multiple color formats includeing HEX, RGB/RGBA, and HSL/HSLA. **Tools used**: TypeScript.

### Recent Projects

- üö≤ **[amsTOURdam](https://github.com/heatherpiper/amsTOURdam-final_capstone)** - Web app that allows users to create custom itineraries from a curated list of experiences and activities within the city of Amsterdam. Users can search and browse a database of landmarks, drag landmark cards into and out of itineraries for easy editing, build custom color-coded routes, and upload photos of their travels. This was my final capstone project for Tech Elevator's Java bootcamp. **Tools used**: Java, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, Vue.js, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, GitLab, Google Maps API, Cloudinary API.

### Future Projects

- üé® Custom color themes for IntelliJ IDEA and VS Code
- ü§î Trivia Trainer - a quiz app focused on training the user to retain information an improve performance for in-person trivia nights. Questions will be categorized in a database to allow for filtering based on the user's chosen criteria to allow for the focus to be on domains in need of improvement.

I am currently a full-stack developer-student through Tech Elevator's coding bootcamp in Columbus, OH.

I am (or will be) learning Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SQL.

I am interested in developing apps that find solutions to problems that people didn't even realize were possible. In the future I hope to explore specialized areas like AI, crypto, and Android app development.
